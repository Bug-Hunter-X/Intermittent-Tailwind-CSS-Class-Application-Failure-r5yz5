# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Class Application Failure

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply consistently. The issue is intermittent and does not produce any obvious errors in the browser's developer console. The bug seems to relate to how classes are processed when a component mounts or is updated.  

## Bug Report
The primary issue is that some Tailwind classes do not get applied, even when they are correctly written in the component's markup. This is not a consistent issue, making debugging more difficult.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind's directives are correctly applied, particularly in relation to dynamically generated content or elements that might be added or updated after the initial render.  We check for various situations that could cause this error. We then enforce strict class application.  This might involve more direct styling or explicitly setting the `class` attribute.
